Installing OpenELIS on Linux

The installer has to be run from a writable file system.  This means that running it from a CD will not work.  
It should be copied to the local file system.

The install script, setup_OpenELIS.py will install global OpenELIS.

The version being installed will depend on the war file included with the installer.

It is assumed that python, tomcat5.5 and postgresql 8.3 or later have already been installed on the target machine.  
Python is needed to run the script and tomcat and postgresql are required for the application.
The script will check for the correct versions before it continues.

THE SCRIPT MUST BE RUN WITH ROOT PERMISSIONS.    
The installation targets do not allow non-admins to write to them and the database has to bootstrap to add OpenELIS users
It should also be run from the directory where the script lives

Options for the running the script

setup_OpenELIS.py <options>
    This script must be run as sudo or else it will fail due to permission problems.

-install  - Installs OpenELIS.  Assumes that there is not a partial install

-installBackup - Installs just the backup.  Will overwrite any existing backup

-installCrossTabs - Install just the crosstab functionality into Postgress to allow export to work

-update - Updates OpenElis.  Checks to insure that the instance being updated is the same as the installed

-uninstall - Removes OpenELIS from the system optionally including the database. Make sure you have the clinlims password written down someplace

-version - The version number of this installer

-help - This screen

Both the update and uninstall options will backup the application war file, the tomcat configuration file and the database 
to the .rolback directory.  By example
